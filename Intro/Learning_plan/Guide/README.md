# Reference Guide

You are encouraged to download this [sheet](cheetsheet.pdf), which contains most of the notation and algorithms that we will use in the first part of this course. Please only use this sheet as a supplement to your own notes! :)

Another useful notation guide can be found in the pages immediately preceding Chapter 1 of the [textbook](http://go.udacity.com/rl-textbook).
