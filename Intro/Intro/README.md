## Concepts
1. [Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jSFl5kxIBs)
1. [Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV6B84mKRNM)
	* Read about [TD-Gammon](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590hk/01sp/Readings/tesauro95cacm.pdf), one of the first successful applications of neural networks to reinforcement learning.
	* Read about [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/), the state-of-the-art computer program that defeats professional human Go players.
	* Learn about how reinforcement learning (RL) is used to play [Atari games](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/).
	* Read about [OpenAI's bot](https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/) that beat the world’s top players of [Dota 2](http://www.dota2.com/play/).
	* Read about [research](https://deepmind.com/blog/producing-flexible-behaviours-simulated-environments/) used to teach humanoid bodies to walk.
	* Learn about RL for [self-driving cars](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/).
	* To see an example of RL applied to finance, check out this [final project](https://github.com/ucaiado/QLearning_Trading) from a student who graduated from the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. You may also enjoy this [friendly introduction](http://www.wildml.com/2018/02/introduction-to-learning-to-trade-with-reinforcement-learning/) to learning to trade with reinforcement learning.
	* Learn about RL for [telecommunication](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1740-low-power-wireless-communication-via-reinforcement-learning.pdf).
	* Read [this paper](https://goo.gl/e3gaM2) that introduces RL for inventory management.

	> As part of this course, we will recommend excerpts from this [classic textbook on reinforcement learning](http://go.udacity.com/rl-textbook).
	> Note that all of the suggested readings are optional!
	> Check out this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction) to see Python implementations of most of the figures in the book.
	> Before transitioning to the next lesson, you are encouraged to read Chapter 1 (especially 1.1-1.4) of the [textbook](http://go.udacity.com/rl-textbook) to get a nice introduction to the field of reinforcement learning.
	> The video is mentioning the Slack channel as one of the resources to access to. Please note that we have updated our Support resources, which means that we will no longer be using Slack. Instead of Slack, we are excited to announce that students now have access to Student Hub!
