1. (Optional) Challenge: Learning from Pixels
	> In the project, your agent learned from information such as its velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around its forward direction. A more challenging task would be to learn directly from pixels!
	> To solve this environment, you will need to design a convolutional neural network as the DQN architecture. For inspiration about how to set up this architecture, please refer to the [DQN paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf).
	> This task will take much longer to train than the project, and (unless you are very patient :D) you're encouraged to use a GPU to train. If you don't have a local GPU setup, you can learn how to train the project on AWS by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md). Note that it is not possible to train this agent in the provided Udacity Workspace.
